# genesis

y0gheebear (yJR) retained k40t1c4 (k40) for expertise in Interactive Experiences (primarily videogames), they discovered mutual areas of interest:
  - yJR has been interested / involved in philanthropy and volunteering locally in San Francisco for several years, in addition to a career in Inside Sales
  - k40 has decades of experience abroad in these endeavours, as well as a career as a Video Game Producer

# high level overview

yJR and k40 agree on several points:
  - `philanthropic-focus`:  some portion of the global citizenry will opt for fulfilling activities such as volunteering, philanthropy in lieu of consumer goods;
  - `charities` can benefit from the same techno-tsunami disrupting wide swaths of the existing 'geographical' business ecosystem;
  - `post-geographicality`:  the portion of 'non-rival goods' (no resources, no waste) in the industrial world-consumption basket has increased over time and this should continue; and 
  - `service`:  one way in which EmpaTheory Research (yJR and k40) can serve the non-profit sector is to provide a resource (information, instruction) on how small 501(c)(3) charities can use technology to get more 'bang for their buck'

 EmpaTheory is therefore contemplating one narrow remit:  to be a one-stop source of info for charities to get the most out of technology
