# what we do

started as a research project by yJR and k40 who share overlapping interests in technology and philanthropy, EmpaTheory Research refined it's focus to:
- helping charities, specifically small- to medium-sized `registered 501(c)(3) entities`, use technology efficiently;
- helping tech initiatives discover the value of customizing their offerings for this space, even if the end payout seems potentially less than a straight for-profit focus;
- assisting Endowments and other sources of philanthropic assitance to support their existing initiatives by illustrating the productivity gains from technology;  and
- giving access / intersection to potential teammembers who want to get involved 

# core products

EmpaTheory commences 2020 with a focus on the assembly / management of three data-sets:
- `tech-for-phil`:  technology initiatives specifically oriented towards philanthropic endeavours;
- `phil-for-tech`:  philanthropic initiatives that can benefit from technology ingress; and
- `tech-friendly endowments`:  philanthropic funding pools / management teams who seek to improve the productivity of their supported philanthropic initiatives;

# covid-19 update

in the same manner SMEs are adapting to human behaviour changes (viz:  less in-person meetings), small- and medium-sized charities might benefit from `virtualization`
- web- and phone-based communications including ubiquitous video conferencing via google hangouts (g+h/o), whatsApp, skype, zoom, facetime, facebook video, etc
- cloud-based repositories of documentation, actionable instruments
- online group meetings
- daily status updates by remote
